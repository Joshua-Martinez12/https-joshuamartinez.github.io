            Bobby Seale is a prominent figure in American history, known as a cofounder of the Black Panther Party (BPP), which emerged in the 1960s as a response to police brutality and systemic racism affecting African Americans. Born on October 22, 1936, in Dallas, Texas, Seale's early life was marked by challenges, including an abusive household. After moving to Berkeley, California, and dropping out of high school, he enlisted in the U.S. Air Force. Following his discharge, Seale became increasingly involved in activism, coauthoring the Black Panther Party's Ten Point Program in 1966.
