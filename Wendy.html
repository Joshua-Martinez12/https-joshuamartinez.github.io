    Enough to break the chains”

Love feels dangerous in a world like this,
But still my heart reaches for yours.
Even bruised, it keeps beating.

I’ve been broken before.
I’ve seen the world turn cold
And pretend my pain was invisible.
But still my heart keeps beating like 
It refuses to die.

I believe in small miracles: 
Your hand in mine,
A breath i didnt think i had 
left a love that survives the wreckage. 

Love scare the world
Because it can't be chained,
Because it heals what was
Meant to stay wounded.

But we love anyway.
We hope anyway.
We rise anyway.

Hope grows in us
Like a secret revolution.
A quiet promise 
That we deserve more than survival.

And together even
Shaking, even scared 
We are brave enough
To break the bars they built around our lives.
