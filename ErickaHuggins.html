            Ericka Huggins is a human rights activist, poet, educator, former Black Panther member and political prisoner.

            Ericka’s political activism began in 1963, when she attended the ‘March on Washington’ and committed to moving from the sidelines to the frontlines in the global human rights movement. In 1969, at age 18, she became a leader in the Los Angeles chapter of the Black Panther Party with her husband John Huggins. She spent 14 years working with the Black Panther Party - the longest of any woman in leadership.
