            Sankofa: A Black Feminist Poem 

I go back because my spirit asks me to,
because somewhere behind me
my grandmothers are still waiting
with lessons wrapped in their palms.
Sankofa tells me that what I need
is not always ahead
sometimes it’s tucked behind the wounds
I tried not to r aeopen.
Still, I turn around,
because healing requires honesty,
and honesty requires returning.

When I reach back, I find “it”
the ancestral knowing I once feared was lost. I hear the spiritual chants my mother hummed,the wisdom hidden in my aunties’ laughter,the strength braided into my roots
by women who survived storms without shelter.

They give me understanding, a cultural freedom that feels like breath,
a power that settles into my bones
and reminds me that Black womanhood
is not a weight it is an inheritance.

I bring all of that into the present with me.
It changes how I walk, how I speak to myself, how I love my people.
Sankofa teaches me to turn memory into movement to use what I recovered
to break cycles of silence, to question everything they taught us to obey,
to free my mind from the lies
that tried to shrink my existence.

With my reclaimed history at my side,
I step toward the future not as a single body,
but as a continuation of many.
Every lesson I carry forward
becomes a gift for the next generation
a reminder that we rise higher
when we know where we come from.

This is how I honor my lineage:
by letting the past sharpen my voice,
steady my purpose, and shape a world
where collective liberation is not a dream
but a practice.

Sankofa transforms me
mind unbound, body restored, soul decolonized. In that transformation,
I learn that going back
is not about returning to pain,
but returning to power.
